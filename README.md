## How to Change Dataset üîÑ

To change the character set or customize the available options:

1. **Modify the `characters` Object**:  
   In the JavaScript file (`script.js`), the `characters` object defines the available characters for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. You can add or modify these values based on your needs.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const characters = {
       lowercase: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
       uppercase: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
       numbers: "0123456789",
       symbols: "^!$%&|[](){}:;.,*+-#@<>~"
   }
   ```

2. **Customize Password Options**:  
   If you want to add more password settings (like more character categories or constraints), simply add more checkboxes in the HTML under the `.pass-settings` section and update the logic in `script.js`.
